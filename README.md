# DuneManager by Ace

Local Windows GUI manager for the Dune Awakening Self-Hosted Server package.

## Run

```powershell
.\Start-DuneManager.bat
```

The launcher opens the GUI and requests Administrator access automatically. Administrator access is required for Hyper-V VM setup, VM start/stop, switch setup, and repair actions.

## Server Package Detection

DuneManager looks for the official Steam server package through Steam registry data, Steam `libraryfolders.vdf`, and common Steam library paths across local drives. You can override detection by setting:

```powershell
$env:DUNE_SERVER_ROOT = "<your Steam library>\steamapps\common\Dune Awakening Self-Hosted Server"
```

If the package is not found, the manager shows `Steam server package not found` and keeps VM-only actions available where possible.

## Source Checkout Note

The release ZIP includes its PowerShell SSH dependency. If you run the source files without the bundled `lib` folder, DuneManager downloads the same SSH.NET package from NuGet the first time password-based SSH setup is needed.

## Main Features

- First-time setup automation: VM import, Hyper-V switch setup, VM memory, SSH key setup, password change, IP setup, bootstrap upload, and initial battlegroup setup.
- Region selection during first-time setup.
- Server settings editor for world title, Sietch name, join password, PvP, security zones, resource multipliers, storms, sandworm behavior, durability, deterioration, and building limits.
- Reinstall-safe local backups and restores for the battlegroup database plus manager-edited ini settings.
- Health watchdog with optional safe auto-repair.
- Manual repair button for failed startup/schema pods and stopped battlegroups.
- Quick actions for status, start, restart, stop, update, local backup, logs, file browser, and Director.
- Existing install detection that locks reinstall behind `Replace existing VM / reinstall`.

## Health Watchdog

The Actions tab has a `Health Watchdog` section:

- `Check Health` asks the VM for live battlegroup, database, gateway, and game-server readiness.
- `Run Repair` starts the VM/world if needed and removes failed one-shot database schema pods so the official operators can recreate them.
- `Enable watchdog` runs health checks on a timer.
- `Auto repair` lets timed checks apply the same safe repairs.
- `Keep world running` allows the watchdog to request a start when the battlegroup is stopped.

The watchdog does not delete saves or reinstall the server.

## Settings

1. Open `Start-DuneManager.bat`.
2. Go to `Settings`.
3. Press `Load Current`.
4. Edit the values you want.
5. Press `Apply Settings`.

The settings action backs up `UserEngine.ini` and `UserGame.ini` inside the VM before changing them. `Restart after apply` restarts the battlegroup so game servers pick up the new values immediately.

## Backups And Restore

Use `Actions` -> `Local Backup` to create a reinstall-safe backup under:

```text
DuneManager\backups
```

The local backup includes the official battlegroup database dump, the battlegroup YAML when available, and the `UserEngine.ini` / `UserGame.ini` settings edited by the manager.

To restore after a reinstall:

1. Run first-time setup so the VM and battlegroup exist again.
2. Go to `Actions` -> `Restore Backup`.
3. Select the `.tar.gz` archive from `DuneManager\backups`.
4. Confirm the restore warning.

Restore stops the battlegroup, imports the selected database backup, restores manager-edited ini files when present, applies default user settings, and starts the battlegroup again.

## Cleanup

To remove generated/imported Dune server instances without touching the Steam server package, run:

```powershell
.\Remove-InstalledInstances.bat
```
